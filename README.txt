For this project I decided to implement CSS into the pages I created in projects 1 & 2.

Home Page - Contains radial gradients and transitions when you hover over the locations, border changes (along with other basic styling).
Menu Page - Utilizes grid layouts to display the menu information (previously used tables) (also contains other basic styling)
Shop Page - Hovering over your cart items will highlight them with a background color, hovering over the trash will highlight it red, there are 
            also some border changes (also contains other basic styling)
Game Page - The title is a rotating animation and when you hover over the instructions they get a text shadow. (also contains other basic styling)
Nutrition Page - When you hover over an individual item in the chart it enlarges to make it easier to read, shadows on the titles  (also contains other basic styling)

everything.css - Contains styling that was the same in all pages
